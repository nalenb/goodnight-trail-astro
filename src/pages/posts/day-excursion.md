Mr. Knightly overlooking the ice-covered reservoir.

After eyeballing different floor plans and adding more insulation, we took Lacey (my husky-mix) and Okra (my daughter's dog that we are sitting for) on a day excursion to Curt Gowdy State Park.

Inquisitive attention drawn to the ice fishing across the frozen water.

Lacey starts to fall asleep after exploring and the rest soon follow.

Why did we name our van? Much to the dismay of Bill, I named our van because our daughters have this tradition to name their cars. Usually a funny name. Like our small suv, our Honda Element, Katie named Herbert. So silly, fun, unique? Whatever you like. Our new van just seemed to need to have a name since we waited so long to buy one. There we are.

So, Bill and I have this running debate about two prominent characters in Jane Austen novels, Pride and Prejudice and in Emma, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Knightley. Whom is more of a gentleman? Well, Bill thinks that Mr. Darcy wins the discussion and I think Mr. Knightley does. And, well, Knightley does go with our Goodnight Trail theme and since Bill doesn't care about naming our van and I do, then well, Mr. Knightley it is. Bill is a good guy and is always wanting to improve himself and do the best job at everything he does but is quite humble about not being perfect. Much like Mr. Darcy in his ways, but striving for Mr. Knightley's sensitive, kindness in going about it. By the way, this is allll my perspective on it all lol!
