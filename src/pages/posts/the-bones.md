Bill has been so excited to start getting the parts delivered that he needs in order to start getting the bones built. The bed frame is being made out of 8020 (pronounced, eighty twenty) aluminum rails series 15 and many of their other parts for a lightweight, strong, rust proof, mold proof, easy to assemble and easy to move around for a modular floorplan if we want to change things later. We're using 8020 10 series for the sink cabinet since we don't need the heavy duty rails.

Check out the bones so far...
