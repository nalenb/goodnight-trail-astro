Well this was a project that took a LOT longer than anticipated. Not a great start to building out our van. Reviews said that this was a difficult, time consuming, frustrating addition to put on, and they were right. Lining the bolts through the holes proved to be very difficult trying to see and finagle them in. I ended up just standing by, mostly bored, feeling badly and trying to be where Bill needed me and anticipating what tool or part he was going to need.
