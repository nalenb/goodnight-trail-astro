"...Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes, And Nod is a little head,

And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies Is a wee one's trundle-bed;

So shut your eyes while Mother sings Of wonderful sights that be,

And you shall see the beautiful things As you rock in the misty sea

Where the old shoe rocked the fisherman three:-

Wynken, Blynken, And Nod." Eugene Field - 1850-1895

Mr. Knightley is winking until the rain stops so we can put the other window in.

Time to nod.

Update: We love having windows to see out the back!
