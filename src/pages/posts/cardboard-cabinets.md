We've been trying out some more 3d ideas to see how everything will fit, including us!! Bill has been using cardboard and some thin wood planks to build our latest layout thoughts. We did realize that we needed a smaller stove top and that a one-burner should suffice instead of two anyway. The stove top will be in a drawer to pull out when needed to make counter space available most of the time we are not cooking. It turns out that it really helps to see how things may need adjusting.

Two-burner cooktop. Nope. We could make it work, but not worth it.

We do like the countertop extension idea!
