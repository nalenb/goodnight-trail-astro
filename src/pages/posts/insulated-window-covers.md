Time to use the cute material I bought! Window covers for your van cost so much money and I am a fairly creative creature who does not like to spend more money than I have to. I like a good project and I don't like to follow directions or patterns, but rather like to come up with my own ideas, mostly because there is usually nothing out there, exactly what I want. That is the instance here, which are custom window covers. They help to keep the warmth in and the cold out or vice versa depending on the season. In the summer heat they will also greatly help to keep the strong sun from baking the inside of your van.

I sandwiched a cute material with a pattern on it that surrounds our Goodnight Trail theme for the inside with a reflectix material on the inside which helps to keep a stiff enough form and yet it is easy to roll up. Then on the side facing outside, I used the 3M Thinsulate which is a great moisture and insulating barrier. I also used the 3M spray adhesive to help keep it all in place. It did make for a think sandwich to send through my homemaker, but sturdy sewing machine, but it was still manageble enough even around the corners where the "goodnight" material needed to be folded. I still want to add some tabs to put magnets in to give it an extra, snap in place, but I'm so happy with how it came out! Yippee!

My first window cover fits great!

The cover presses nicely into place, but I will still add magnets for extra stay.

I was afraid the sandwich would fall apart while sewing, so I used just a little spray adhesive.
