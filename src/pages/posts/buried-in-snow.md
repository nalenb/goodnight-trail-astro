Wow. It didn't take long for everything to come to a halt. Cheyenne, Wyoming received 31-36" of snow in just two days. Yeah, that's like 3' of snow and the snow drifts were up to 6' or more.

The delivery trucks had found us in our brand new neighborhood even though we don't exist on any map apps yet. All we had to do is order a lot of stuff online and they quickly found us! Bill has been ordering van build stuff and I have been ordering new house stuff from aluminum rails and fans and sinks to cabinet and drawer pulls, step stools and towel racks so we had a lot a supplies to work with as we've had a continuous flow of packages,

until SNOWMAGEDDON 2021.

The first shoveled path was directly to our van, Mr. Knightly.

8020 alluminum rails went in for our sliding bed to couch.

Temporary shower stall.

After putting up the temporary shower stall behind the driver seat, we realized we wanted to make the give-and-take decision to adjust how much room it takes up for the one time a day we use it. It will be hidden in a bench height box for a seat or foot stool and raise it up to the ceiling for our shower. The idea is to do the same for the potty on the opposite side or put it in the same space. That we can decide a little further on in the process.

When the storm finally gave way, we and our new neighbors worked hard to make a crude path through the snow drifts to get an emergency road in case of any scary situations as we already knew that firetrucks and snow plows got stuck and were not a viable option. First responders were asking for snow mobilers to help out after giving up during the storm to get streets cleared. Days later we started to see huge front loaders being used to get streets passable. No deliveries for a week, but Snowmageddon 2021 did not stop us from working on our plans for Mr. Knightly and making our final decisions as to where everything is going in our floorplan.
