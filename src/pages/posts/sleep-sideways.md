Our sideways sleeping prototype works for our 6'2" Bill which would save space along the sides for other essentials like most other van camper builds do, but it doesn't quite feel like enough stretching space and we don't want to climb over each other to get in and out of bed. It warmed up to 19 degrees for us while working. Snug as a bug with our heater.

To be sideways...or not to be...

He just barely fits sideways but crawling over each other to get out of bed might get old. The plan to follow is to build the van to function as close to home as possible.

We tried putting the bed behind the front seats just to see, and once again, there would be a lot of crawling to get out of bed or to the front.
