  Our 2020 AWD Ford Transit 350, EcoBoost 148 Long, High Roof Let me introduce you to Mr. Knightley
  and come along on our journey as we achieve our dreams of driving the road less traveled to
  explore the beautiful landscapes, vistas and enticing towns. We have imagined for over 7 years
  now, building a camper van to explore in. Since Bill has worked remotely for 17+ years and our
  kids are mostly on their own, we moved to a smaller house, a simpler life and we have been ready
  to make our dream a reality. In January of 2021, vans were hard to come by. It seems many had the
  same idea that we did and there was even more competition to purchase vans, new or used, for
  commercial deliveries as Covid pushed more buying online. Bill says, “Hey Honey! How about a day
  trip to look at vans to see if anyone has any?” This is not out of the blue for him. I roll with
  it, but it is no longer a far off dream. This could happen now. I can’t count how many times we
  eyed all of the van options and weighed the pros and cons of each to build our camper van. As Bill
  is 6’2″, we wanted a tall roof and realized that the Ram ProMasters might be too short and we
  didn’t want to deal with the Sprinter costs and inconveniences to maintain or worry about diesel
  fuel, even though that kind of gasoline was cheaper then. Well, surprise, surprise, there was one
  Ford Transit, high roof with the length we wanted (to fit in our short driveway) AND it was
  All-Wheel Drive!! This van was the perfect package for our dream vacation home on wheels so we
  bought it new off the lot. We have loved our choice and have been traveling in it as we build and
  make it our perfect tiny home RV. Our first ride down a country road. The name Mr. Knightley comes
  from one of the main characters in Jan Austen’s novel Emma. Bill and I have this running debate
  about which of the gentlemen, Mr. Knightley from Emma or Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice is the
  best gentleman. Well, since I think Mr. Knightley takes the title, I am the one who wanted to name
  the van, and his name goes best with our theme Goodnight Trail, then Mr. Knightley it is! – Ahem,
  “Knightley” for short. Check out what we have accomplished on our van build so far… Our camper van
  has two bench seating with comfortable capacity for 4-6 people. Convertible benches easily
  transform into an oversized, almost queen bed. We have solar power and engine powered batteries
  that continuously run our refrigerator/ freezer drawer which can keep a couple of weeks worth of
  food including ice cream that doesn’t even get soft. A microwave and convection stove top make for
  convenient home-cooked meals. A portable shower easily pushes away to make for an open-concept
  tiny home when not in use and a portable potty box is cleverly hidden in a cabinet that doubles as
  a foot stool or extra cushioned bench seat. Kitchen Cabinet Potty Box/Seat Shower Curtain Home is
  Where the Trail Is
