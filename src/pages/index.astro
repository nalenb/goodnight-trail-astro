      We continue to build a camper van, our vacation home on wheels to explore in, to get us to the
      many places we want to vacation and explore around. We want to scout the roads less traveled,
      cruise the interstates and tour everything in between to experience the beauties to behold
      from purple mountains majesty, through amber waves of grain, fruited plains, from sea to
      shining sea, and hopefully even into Canada and possibly South America. We endeavor to
      participate in celebrations across the country, meet new people and cities and hike the many
      trails just waiting for our new eyes to revere. We traverse in Mr. Knightley even as we
      continue to perfect our vacation home on the road. When we travel, home is where the trail is.

    <p>This was the most stunning hiking destination; Taggart Lake with Grand Teton views.</p>
